# Multi-Organization Revenue Management System - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive step-by-step implementation for extending your existing church finance system to support multiple organization types (churches, schools, NGOs, businesses) with organization-specific modules and features.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Database Schema Extensions

The system now supports:

1. **Organization Management**
   - `Organization` model with type classification
   - Organization-specific settings and configurations
   - Multi-tenant data isolation

2. **School-Specific Models**
   - `Student` - Student information and enrollment
   - `AcademicYear` - Academic year management
   - `FeeCategory` - Fee categorization
   - `FeeStructure` - Fee structure definitions
   - `StudentFeePayment` - Fee payment tracking
   - `StudentBalance` - Student account balances
   - `FeeReminder` - Automated fee reminders
   - `FeeExemption` - Fee exemption management

3. **Generic Balance System**
   - Works for both church members and school students
   - Supports multiple balance types (CREDIT, DEBIT, PLEDGE, PREPAID)
   - Currency-aware balance tracking

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration

1. **Apply the database migration:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

2. **Verify the migration:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

3. **Seed default organization:**
   The migration automatically creates a default organization for existing data.

### Step 2: Backend API Setup

The following new API endpoints have been added:

#### Organization Management
- `GET /api/organizations` - List all organizations
- `GET /api/organizations/:id` - Get organization details
- `POST /api/organizations` - Create new organization
- `PATCH /api/organizations/:id` - Update organization
- `DELETE /api/organizations/:id` - Deactivate organization
- `GET /api/organizations/:id/stats` - Get organization statistics
- `POST /api/organizations/:id/switch` - Switch organization context

#### Student Management (School-specific)
- `GET /api/students` - List students with filtering
- `GET /api/students/:id` - Get student details
- `POST /api/students` - Create new student
- `PATCH /api/students/:id` - Update student
- `DELETE /api/students/:id` - Deactivate student
- `GET /api/students/:id/fee-payments` - Get student fee payments
- `GET /api/students/:id/balances` - Get student balances
- `POST /api/students/:id/fee-payments` - Record fee payment

#### Fee Management (School-specific)
- `GET /api/fees/academic-years` - List academic years
- `POST /api/fees/academic-years` - Create academic year
- `GET /api/fees/categories` - List fee categories
- `POST /api/fees/categories` - Create fee category
- `GET /api/fees/structures` - List fee structures
- `POST /api/fees/structures` - Create fee structure
- `GET /api/fees/reports/collection` - Fee collection report
- `GET /api/fees/reports/outstanding` - Outstanding fees report

### Step 3: Frontend Integration

#### 1. Update App Context

Add the OrganizationProvider to your main App component:

```tsx
import { OrganizationProvider } from './context/OrganizationContext';

function App() {
  return (
    <OrganizationProvider>
      {/* Your existing app components */}
    </OrganizationProvider>
  );
}
```

#### 2. Update Navigation

The navigation will automatically adapt based on organization type:

```tsx
import { useOrganization } from './context/OrganizationContext';

function Navigation() {
  const { getOrganizationRoutes, currentOrganization } = useOrganization();
  const routes = getOrganizationRoutes();
  
  return (
    <nav>
      {routes.map(route => (
        <Link key={route.path} to={route.path}>
          {route.name}
        </Link>
      ))}
    </nav>
  );
}
```

#### 3. Organization-Specific Pages

- **Church Pages**: Members, Contributions, Projects (existing)
- **School Pages**: Students, Fee Management, Academic Years (new)

### Step 4: Role-Based Access Control

#### Organization-Specific Roles

1. **Church Roles:**
   - Pastor
   - Finance Officer
   - Member

2. **School Roles:**
   - Principal
   - Finance Officer
   - Teacher
   - Student

#### Permission Matrix

| Feature | Admin | Finance Officer | Teacher | Member/Student |
|---------|-------|----------------|---------|----------------|
| User Management | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Organization Settings | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Financial Reports | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Student/Member Management | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Fee/Contribution Collection | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| View Own Records | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

### Step 5: Caching and Performance Optimization

#### Redis Integration

1. **Install Redis:**
   ```bash
   npm install redis
   ```

2. **Cache Strategy:**
   - Organization settings (TTL: 1 hour)
   - Student/Member lists (TTL: 30 minutes)
   - Balance summaries (TTL: 15 minutes)
   - Reports (TTL: 1 hour)

3. **Cache Implementation:**
   ```javascript
   const redis = require('redis');
   const client = redis.createClient();

   // Cache organization data
   const getCachedOrganization = async (orgId) => {
     const cached = await client.get(`org:${orgId}`);
     if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);
     
     const org = await prisma.organization.findUnique({ where: { id: orgId } });
     await client.setex(`org:${orgId}`, 3600, JSON.stringify(org));
     return org;
   };
   ```

### Step 6: Reusable Components

#### BalanceCard Component
- Works for both church members and school students
- Displays different labels based on organization type
- Supports multiple balance types and currencies

#### TransactionHistory Component
- Generic transaction display
- Organization-specific transaction details
- Filtering and pagination support

#### OrganizationSwitcher Component
- Allows users to switch between organizations
- Maintains user context and permissions

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# Organization Settings
DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_TYPE=CHURCH
ENABLE_ORGANIZATION_SWITCHING=true

# Redis Configuration
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
REDIS_TTL=3600

# Feature Flags
ENABLE_SCHOOL_FEATURES=true
ENABLE_CHURCH_FEATURES=true
```

### Organization Settings

Each organization can have custom settings:

```json
{
  "currency": "USD",
  "fiscalYearStart": "January",
  "feeReminderDays": 7,
  "autoGenerateReceipts": true,
  "requireParentApproval": false,
  "enableOnlinePayments": true
}
```

## üìä Reporting and Analytics

### Church Reports
- Member contribution summaries
- Project funding progress
- Monthly/yearly financial reports
- Member engagement analytics

### School Reports
- Fee collection reports
- Outstanding fees by student/grade
- Payment trends analysis
- Academic year financial summaries

### Cross-Organization Reports
- Multi-organization financial overview
- Comparative analytics
- System-wide statistics

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Isolation
- All queries include organization context
- User permissions are organization-specific
- API endpoints validate organization access

### Audit Trail
- All financial transactions are logged
- User actions are tracked by organization
- Data changes include organization context

### Access Control
- JWT tokens include organization context
- Role-based permissions per organization
- API rate limiting per organization
